      <p>
        The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the
        United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in
        North America. It is a federation of 50 states, a federal capital
        district (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations. Outside the
        union of states, it asserts sovereignty over five major unincorporated
        island territories and various uninhabited islands.[j] The country has
        the world's third-largest land area,[d] second-largest exclusive
        economic zone, and third-largest population, exceeding 334 million.[k]
        Paleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000
        years ago. British colonization led to the first settlement of the
        Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown
        over taxation and political representation sparked the American
        Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring
        independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the Revolutionary
        War (1775–1783), the country continued to expand across North America.
        As more states were admitted, sectional division over slavery led to the
        secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the
        remaining states of the Union during the 1861–1865 American Civil War.
        With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished
        nationally. By 1890, the United States had established itself as a great
        power. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S.
        entered World War II. The aftermath of the war left the U.S. and the
        Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War,
        during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological
        dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Union's
        collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S. emerged as the
        world's sole superpower. The U.S. national government is a presidential
        constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate
        branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral
        national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower
        house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal
        representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is given to states
        and several territories, with a political culture that emphasizes
        liberty, equality under the law, individualism, and limited government.
        One of the world's most developed countries, the United States has had
        the largest nominal GDP since 1890 and accounted for 15% of the global
        economy in 2023.[l] It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of
        any country and the highest disposable household income per capita among
        OECD countries.[20] The U.S. ranks among the world's highest in economic
        competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher
        education. Its hard power and cultural influence have a global reach.
        The U.S. is a founding member of the World Bank, IMF, Organization of
        American States, NATO, World Health Organization, and a permanent member
        of the UN Security Council.
